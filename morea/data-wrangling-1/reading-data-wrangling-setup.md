For this workshop, there's no need for a local setup as we'll utilize Google Colab for code execution.

To access Google Colab, you should have:

1. An personal Gmail account, or
2. A University of Hawaii account.

If you're using a University of Hawaii email, please enable the Google Consumer Apps for Your Google@UH Account by following the steps provided here: `https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1649`.

Ensure this is done before attending the workshop.


During the workshop, we'll share all URLs and notes on this [Google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lz7WUSZwvSFC7JxyPiVOsfLq_aPWa3xlfEtIHfCdT3Q/edit?usp=sharing)
