# 1. Icebreaker

#### Let's Get Started
Break up into small groups of 3-4 people. Try to be in a group with people you haven't met before. These are the people you will be sitting next to for the remainder of the workshop. 

#### Tasks
1. Introduce yourself to your group members. Name, background, your research, and your favorite snack combo!

2. Appoint one person to be the "scribe" and take notes on your conversation.

3. Each person share the with the group about what they are excited for. Whether it's involving your career, your work, a project your working on, or in your personal life like a delicious dinner. 

You have 5 minutes to introduce everyone in the group, and then have the scribe take notes while everyone is briefly describing what they are excited for. 

After 5 minutes, each group will present what they are all excited for (five minutes total).
