# 1. Ice Breaker: Climate Change Model

Task: 

1. The instructors will provide 13 Climate Fresk cards that corresponds to a climate change factor/element.

2. Each participant will be assigned one (1) Climate Fresk card. Collaborate with your peers and collectively make an educated guess on how each climate change factor is linked to each other. 

3. Once the class comes to a consensus on the climate change model, the instructors will lock in the hypothesis on the whiteboard.

4. Hold onto this hypothesis. We will assess the data throughout the workshop to see what the data actually says.
