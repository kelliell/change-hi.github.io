# 1. Ice Breaker: Data Movement Challenges

Break into small groups. Try to find people you haven't met yet for your group.

Task: 

 1. Introduce yourself to your group members. Name, background, degree program and your favorite movie.

 2. Each person can briefly describe any challenges they've faced with data storage and movement, and solutions they've tried.

You have five minutes to discuss with your group.
