# 1. Ice Breaker: How do you use computing?

Break into small groups. Try to be in a group with people you haven't met before.
 
Task: 

1. Introduce yourself to your group members. Name, background, degree program and your favorite movie.

2. Each person should briefly describe a project (professional or passion) which they're currently using computing for. Briefly describe the project goals, what frameworks/language/libray you're using, and tell us how things are progressing! 

Please spend five minutes having everyone describe their current computational projects, and have the scribe note it down. 

You have five minutes to discuss with your group. Then each person will share a 1-sentence recap of their computing project with everyone (five minutes total).
