# 1. Ice Breaker: Climate Fresk

The instructors will introduce Climate Fresk cards that each correspond to a climate change factor/element.
 
### Task: 

1. Collaborate with your peers to collectively create a climate change hypothesis regarding how each factor or element is linked to one another. 

2. Once the class comes to a consensus on the climate change model, the instructors will lock in the hypothesis on this shared Google Slide: [Climate Fresq](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13LXlBwBo1M4IRdF3K1uq5_U_FXInqP216wlHB8ESqcM/edit?usp=sharing) 
 
3. Hold onto this hypothesis. We'll analyze the data throughout the workshop to see what the data really says about their relationships. 

### Climate Change Factors/Elements:

* CO2 Concentration
* CO2 Emissions
* Drought
* Fossil Fuels
* Greenhouse Gases (Other than CO2)
* Radiative Forcing
* Rising Sea Levels
* Rising Surface Temperatures
