# Mini Lab #3: Modeling Times Series
1. Additive Model–use the decompose function to break apart the trend, seasonal, and irregular components. (Make sure type equals a.)

2. Expand the components further by applying the decomposition function to each figure. What can you assess from the overall trend? Overall seasonality? 

3. Multiplicative Model–use the decompose function to break  apart the trend, seasonal, and irregular components. (Make sure type equals m.). What can you assess from the irregular component?

# Mini Lab #4: Cross-Correlation and Causality
1. Global Temperature vs. Solar Activity → Is there a correlation? 
2. Global Temperature vs. CO2 Concentration → Is there a correlation? 
3. Concentration vs. CO2 Emission → Is there a correlation? 
4. CO2 Emission vs. Natural Disasters → Is there a correlation?
