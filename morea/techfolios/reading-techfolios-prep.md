## Prepare for the Techfolios workshop

### 1. Join GitHub

For the Techfolios workshop, you will be required to fork a GitHub repository, which will require you to have a GitHub account.

It will save you a few minutes of time during the workshop if you can create your GitHub account prior to the workshop.

If you do not already have a GitHub account, please go to <https://github.com/join> to register. 

Note that if you register with your hawaii.edu account (either as student or faculty), you will be eligible to apply for [educational benefits](https://education.github.com/).  This includes free access to GitHub Copilot! (Enrollment in the education program is not required for the Data Fellows program.)

### 2. Gather portfolio materials

First take a look at the [Techfolio Template Site](https://techfolios.github.io/template/). As you can see, a Techfolio site can potentially contain the following kinds of information about a person:

* A headshot image (cropped into a square (i.e. aspect ratio 1:1)).
* A list of interests
* A list of "projects"
* A list of tech reports or publications. 
* Links to your LinkedIn, Twitter, Insta, etc.
* If you look at the [Template Resume Page](https://techfolios.github.io/template/resume.html), you'll see that the site can also contain a nice version of your resume in HTML format. 

To give a sense for what's possible here's Data Fellow [Arianna Bunnell's portfolio](https://aribunnell.github.io/). 

During the workshop, you'll learn how to construct a portfolio using Techfolios. If you spend a bit of time prior to the workshop collecting together at least some of these materials, you'll be able to build most (maybe even all?) of your professional portfolio by the end of the workshop.
